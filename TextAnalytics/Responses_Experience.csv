The guide ,Specificity over genericity ,Lack of more information,"If there's any thermal contraction, it should be at night, not day...",CTO from Florida in oil and gas. Expert in gas lift. Mentor engineers
Its a raising development that needs monitoring for perfection ,Given that the Gaslift valves are pressure controlled and can be activated by pressure depending on the pressure rating. An increase in Gas injection pressure can activate the deepest valve to ensure the lift gas goes deep enough to carry the fluid up the tubing.,Lack of more information,"If there's an underlying reason for the inconsistency, the new valves could exhibit the same behaviour ","As a 27-year-old woman from Florida working as a CTO in oil and gas, I trust the Al assistant because it gives accurate, relevant, and efficient answers. Impression: Helpful. Trust rating: High"
Pressure likely to fluctuate ,"It's largely dependent on the nature of the well. HTHP or not. The pressure gradient also affects this, for wells with significant pressure gradients it should affect a little. (My thoughts)",Lack of more information,It adheres to normal gas lift injection procedures of having a Min THP of 100 psi during design,Helpful and accurate I trust AI assistant responses
"The valid concern about downhole valve performance, and  the need for thorough diagnostics and cost effective intervention.",I've not run one before.,Lack of more information,"Although the statement makes sense, it is not entirely true as pressure fluctuations is not expected during continuous GL Operations ",It's normal
"Fluctuating GOR is typically a symptom of gas lift instability, valve malfunction, or gas slippage, not something resolved by just opening the choke.",Increasing the injection pressure is an option to ensure the valve fully opens,Lack of more information,"Sure, pressure gradient curve can reveal gas entry points. Not so sure about the effect of shallow gas on the optimization ",None
It oversimplifies a complex system and encourages neglect of a fundamental engineering tool.,The production swing is too significant ,well i feel guilty,"While the statement in itself  makes sense, spiking GOR can definitely be a well control issue ",the trust is high
Lack of first hand knowledge on the subject matter,It is a relevant diagnostic step,this is the best.. soo funn,"The AI certainly has a lot of helpful info however if humans can make mistakes and humans design AI its safe to say there should be some concern. I believe you should ask follow up questions to gather as much info as possible. That ensures if something does go bad you did all you could and not based you decision on AI bc if AI is incorrect on their suggestion and you did as AI suggested with no follow questions or doing your own troubleshooting as well, you not AI are responsible",brudda
LLMs can be confidently wrong and i dont have enough knowledge on the subject matter.,I think it is a problem giving the production swing ,in this i see love,"Follow up just ensures you gather as much info as possible. With the human factor, multiple people's suggestions are heard and used to come up with a solution. Follow up with AI is gathering as much as you can to make the best solution",brudda
"Same reasons as before, lack of first hand kowledge on the subject",The spikes might be due to the faulty valves and wherefore needs investigation,i think this will be worked out,To gather as much info as you can before acting,bruh
Same reasons as before ,Absence of reason why pressure drops during the day and recovers at night and also there was no account for the valve evaluation to check if the valves are in a good working condition ,this is the right answer,Info gathering g,hhhg
Same reasons as before,"Fluctuations in gas supply pressure or rate (from compressor problems, valve issues, etc.) can introduce non-thermal pressure variations",I think the use of artificial intelligence is very important and the suggestions made by Ghaala are very effective.,Info gathering,Ai is a trustworthy application
They’re mere recommendations. There is need to further probe the scenario and look at other possible solutions.,The fact that they miss shallow valves and produce fake positives ,The information provided is very useful.,Diagnostic,Ai is a very smart application
"In my experience of using AI, there has been cases of generic answers which didn’t really solve the problem ",The lack of consideration of gas entering at shallow depth,It is very useful information.,Pressure fluctuate,I use ai in all my businesses
Insufficient information ,Every change in production parameters should be put into consideration and undergo investigation immediately as most of these parameters may account for future or immediate well problems,The information provided is very useful.,Seems to be accurate,If I feel so is wrong I will check other resources
There could be other factors reducing flow beyond just the tubing pressure. Some other parameters need to be checked,The advice is fairly general and doesnt alignment with the anulas bleeding woth day to night variation. The ranking is that it is providing some very basic initial troubleshooting guidance.,Because I think this information is correct.,Research is key,I trust ai fully
For offshore environments that is very likely to happen.,It captured more of the event data in the recommendation. Still lacks a bit on resolution to narrow down options.,I have experience and it's trusted,Realtime diagnosis,Very het
Beyond replacement due to increasing performance. Cost is also a major factor and also the expected flow rate will determine if replacement or diagnosis is a better option.,It gave a good recommendation and action to investigate to resolve the issue.,It's trustworthy and dependable,I really do the old way with his hands on,Very helpful
If the choke is widen too much the pressure declines faster and managing the pressure of the well determines how long the well would produce.,Gave a good recommendation and course of action for i vestigation.,It's to of lost and accurate,Show me things can go wrong with the electrical of the AI. It’s better just to do it hands-on,Idk
"Since we are now using a gas lift method our focus shifts from the pressure depth profile to the annulus and tubing pressure, due to the gas injection from surface. However, the pressure depth profile helps understand how much pressure is needed to inject the gas into the annulus to meet the required pressure head to lift the fluids.",Providing actionable and good specific guidance to resolve the ossue.,Runs smooth with no issues,Things can go wrong with the AI. It’s better to do it by hands-on and that’s why I picked two for the low trust rating.,It would help
"When the pressurized gas travels subsurface, and the valve is actuated, It gives the free will to aerate the oil, thereby restoring bhfp and enhancing flow assurance.",Please go further in depth with your last statement,U don't need to model the recommendation,I don’t trust it,Make sure u keep it a a level
"Gases are injected at different temperatures and as a result of that,the gas lifts may be subjected to expansion and contractions. So, thermal cycling may greatly affect lift stability.",Please go further in depth with the pressure release and its dynamics,"Some other way it is where it is a little weird, but I agree with it. I know most of it to be true.",I don’t trust it,I think it would be a compatible system
"I believe acoustic survey works with the reflection of sound waves to determine the efficiency of gas lift, liquid loading and assessing well performance. Hence, I believe once they are launched, the reflection of sound waves are analyzed another to get results.",Does valve activity constantly shift,I felt like the AI was a little on par but not completely. There needed to be a lot more information.,Unaware of knowing the actual answer,I don't like ignoring the situation
"Shallow gas can poses great risk, but if the production rate keeps fluctuating, the impact of shallow gas entry the can be less severe .",Does the point of rationality merge with other aspects,This response was a bit incorrect. That's not how I would recommend proceeding.,Unaware,I would want some of the information
Spiking Gas-to-Oil ratio is a great indicator of a kick - an influx of formation fluid into the wellbore and if not managed may lead to an escalation or blowout ,Can the downhole separator combine with its partners,This is exactly what I would have suggested. The AI is definitely anpoint.,Unaware,That works for me
Because boosting surface pressure can practically enhance downhole gas distribution. ,Because I can use the Ai to analyze the problem and help me understand a solution to the problem,This is exactly what I would have suggested. The AI is pretty much on point .,Hasn't been using it long,I like how specific it was
"The symptoms particularly annulus pressure fluctuation and inconsistent valve activity, suggest potential issues with gas lift stability, which this step directly addresses.",Because I would prefer to check everything myself and go step by step before I asked AI for assistance,i accepted the recommendation,Seems credible,Its very good and very important
"The 48 hour review period is a good time  for capturing both operational and thermal cycles also, the Annulus pressure behavior over time can reveal valve leak-through, thermal effects, or multipoint injection all of which explain the pressure fluctuation and inconsistent valve activity seen in the well.",I believe that the AI would take an analysis of the problem and give me a solution for the problem to resolve,i chose to accept the recommendation,Need more information,Its very good
The annulus pressure trending over time can reveal thermal effects and mechanical issues like valve leak-through or unintended shallow valve opening.,I would prefer to go over everything and make a check list,i accepted the recommendation,Need more t,Very important
This approach provides a clear method to pinpoint the actual gas entry point along the wellbore by comparing measured pressures to expected profiles. ,I believe the information provided would be helpful to solve the issue at hand,better than others,Seems credible,Its very good and very important for me
"Overlaying GOR with pressure data can uncover dynamic interactions between gas injection and fluid production as a rising GOR alongside falling annulus pressure strongly suggests gas interference, gas lock, or multipoint injection.",AI has been trustworthy from my experience.,better than others,Because it works well and analyze well,Its very good and very important
"It's a common practice to boost surface injection pressure in gas lift. Boosting surface injection pressure can help open deeper valves, which may not be activating if pressure is marginal. But then it will be ideal to support this with a nodal analysis or gas lift design review, because blindly boosting with 100psi without proper analysis could risk over injection or unintended gas behavior ",AI has been correct on all occasions.,Because of transparent,I just want to know more about it,Reliability and Accuracy.
"Thermal cycling from day-night temperature changes can cause pressure variations in the annulus, especially offshore. This seems to be technically sound, but should still be monitored if combined with erratic valve behavior ",It gave the correct steps.,Because there has to be some human interaction,I feel like it gave me in-depth information,I reacted them 4 for their Fairness and Ethical Design.
"Acoustic surveys can help, but they are not always reliable, especially for shallow valves. Might not show much more than what surface trends already reveal.",Explained correctly.,Because it will save you alot of time,I just feel like it's missing some information,I Trust AI respond for there Reliability and Accuracy.
"Makes sense. Pressure-depth checks can show where gas is entering. Shallow entry is not always a big deal, especially with the current flow swings. Depends on the well setup though.",Gave the correct answer,Helping you make a decision,I need to know a little more information than what is given,I trust the AI's respond for there Reliability and Accuracy.
"Could be true. GOR spikes often come from injection issues or separator tweaks. Not usually a serious problem, but I would still keep an eye on it to be sure",I have some knowledge. The ai has allot more information,Very informative,Trust but verify as the stakes are high,Reliability and Accuracy.
The fact that it proposed a solution which I still need to verify,I have some knowledge. The ai has more information,i trust ai very much because now a days AI are getting smart,Trust but verify,"logical because it enhances efficiency and accuracy, helping make better decisions. However, it is essential to handle challenges like training and privacy carefully to avoid negative impacts."
The need to validate the above response using life data,I have some knowledge. The ai has more information,Ai getting more advanced,Seems simple,"logical because it enhances efficiency and accuracy, helping make better decisions. However, it is essential to handle challenges like training and privacy carefully to avoid negative impacts."
The confirm with real time data,I have some knowledge. The ai has more information,Ai is so helpful,4,Because it has proven its effectiveness in many fields.
The possibility that gas entry could cause a problem,I have some knowledge. The ai has more information,"so fast, and time saving",4,I trust your choices
The uncertainty around that,It is very important,need less time,It was a helpful response,I see some reservations about this topic.
If the pressure is fluctuating it could not be running on all cylinders,It is very important,Because I think it's very good,I trust the response time in AI,I see that he is confident of humiliation
It's just an educational guess no real facts,It is very important,Because I think it's very good,AI is helpful,He is right about that.
The actual acoustic valve pressureneeds to be checked,It is very good,Because I think it's very good,Somewhat,Because the additional gas will reduce the bottomhoke pressure by augmenting the formation
We need to see if the simulator is lining up correctly,It is very important,Because it is very good,Somewhat,The thermal cycling isn't the appropriate response to the problem at hand.
We need to see what is interfering,Because everything is different on a rig.,Because it is very good,The response was based on clear product benefits; truest rating reflects credibl eclaims and familiar branding.,"It sounds like possible liquid loading if it wants to run an acoustic survey, which is a proper response to the issue."
Ai pulls credible information front multiple sources,It's dangerous,THE AI IS TRUSTWORTHY AS IT ALIGNS WITH STANDARD RESPONDS,I based my response on clear messaging and rated trust high due to brand reputation and transparency.,Doing the depth gradients can be a very important part in diagnosing the problem. It gives the analysis of the pressure distribution in the bore which can get to the root of the issue.
That’s very close to what my recommendation would have been,Because I can't trust just ai,BETTER TO ME THAN OTHER,The product message was clear and informative; I rated trust highly due to recognizable branding and scientifically supported claims.,The a.i assistant saying there's no need for urgency is false.
"Again, that is what I would have recommended",That is a great response,GOOD TO ME THAN OTHER,Clear product benefits and trustworthy branding influeced my response and resulted in a high truest rating,I already did because the response was very clear. I did really understand it.
I’d rather double check my number before continuing with the AI suggestion,It seems risky,GOOD FOR MY COMPANY,Clear message and trusted brand led to a high trust rating.,It was very clear and detailed. There’s a response was understandable.
Not enough experience,I would want safety factors presented,BETTER THAN OTHER,I think ai is more helpful than hurtful,Response wasn’t really that clear to me. They left me confused.
Not enough experience,I have seen this in the past and it makes sense.,AI make the gaslift easy to understand the procedure,The ai is surprisingly good,The accuracy with which artificial intelligence displays results
Gives more options,What data is determining the failure of the component,The assistant AI gave help me trace the fault,The ai seems to be right to me.,Artificial intelligence highlights a recommendation that must be taken into account.
Gives valve options,I have seen this work in the past,Am neutral with the response,I appreciate the suggestions from ai,It displays its information based on significance.
Gives more options,Never heard of doing this with a reduction problem,Very good and explanatory,The ai suggestion is helpful,It covers a variety of information to solve problems.
I can answer any questions,"With a fully function ai, I would trust it more than a person since it thinks in numbers.",I didnt agree with the response i have to trace fault,"Production fluctuates tetween 1,300 and 2,000 stb/d Annulus pressure drops during the day, partially recovers at night Tubing head pressure down by 20% GOR spikes unpredictably Acoustic tool shows inconsistent valve activity No surface equipment alarms which indicate that something is misfiring",It provides various information to provide the best solutions.
I accept,Ai calculate probabilities and statistics using data from all over the world,It's in the middle because that's how I feel about,Acoustic tool shows inconsistent valve activity which doesn't seem to directly be talked about so I'm neutral but I could be helpful,trust
Because not true,I’m am neutral with this because ai is not that well developed yet. It’s still in the early learning stages,"The medium trust, because I hope fully trusted, but I sort of",It directly has a theory involving the acualissue involving v ing the,trust
No excuses to exit,Ai technology is still young and still need ton adapt and learn,"I would trusted mediumly, because I would want to ask and follow up questi",see if the injection depth lines up with what we expect from the valve spacing.seems not to directly line up with a solution involved w problwn,trust
Gos over lap,Ai uses data to give u the best probability,"Once again, I would have some more questions you did",I just don't help including being something that is hands on for me so it's hard to put into words to where it would make ense,trust
I don't trust AI much,Usually AI is correct 8,I have more questions needing answers,It's a decent general response but I think further evaluation is needed,trust
This makes sense.,No rationale,It fit my needs perfectly and made eblveryday routines so much easir,It's fairly accurate. We've had situations that are similar,just the evidence supported by factual basis.
It's logical.,Not sure about the neutral valve,It worked great for my baby and made daily outings way less stressful,I suspect it is also more of a well control issue more so than anything else,it’s got good intuition about the counterparts.
Not so sure.,I believe it has to do with spacing,It gave me confidence every time we went out and kept my baby safe,Have to double check to see,facts nothing but facts.
It's not so accurate,The pressure probably dipped,It helped stabilize flow and made the we'll feel more predictable daily,Correct pressure,didn’t seem quite right.
It’s a standard operating procedure,"i still would like to see all the pressure data, surface, tubing and annulus",It didn't feel complete and I needed deeper data to trust the device,Procedure compliant,well according to my research it’s correct.
Standard operating procedure,the time in between is the pressure buildup in the reservoir.,This aligns with my thinking on this topic,No safety,As a result of the accuracy of the information it provides
Standard operating procedure,an acoustic log may show that a valve is defective by a different signature allowing flow through the valve,This is something that needs to be,GOR greatly appreciate,Reliable as a result of the information provided
Standard operating procedure,"Yes, using a well simulator to model the pressure-depth and with the acoustic log to check the gas lift design and if the the actual injection depth aligns to the valve spacing",This is an acceptable response in this situation,Monitor your progress,It gives solutions to problems.
Standard operating procedure,it suggests strong gas interference or issues in the injection,This is true and there are not alarms but this is a quick conclusion jump and needs to be investigated further,I think that it explains suggests effectively and doesnt leave me confused,I am trusting in AI
It’s a logical course of action,Decent,This is an acceptable response in this case,It explains in an easy to understand way,Good to get on the solution
Good catch,Decent,The indepth analysis given by the AI and all the other factors taken into place.,This appears to follow what I have done without AI guidance.,
"It’s a little passive, but still leads in the right direction",Quality results,AI analysed the situation and simplified it for everyone to get the job done faster.,This slightly varies from what I would do without AI.,
Better direction with specifics,True results,"AI has given a valid advice for us not to waste resources and time repairing one of the three valves, instead we should replace it entirely.",There are other options to consider.,
Good suggestion,True statement,"AI has recommended that for more produce, we need to open the valve a little more.",It was certain ways the ai put the words in the paragraph I just read.,
What was suggested makes sense and from what little I've learned so far sounds right,Fully trust,"AI has recommended that we don't change the valve just yet, but instead we open it a little more and let it operate like that for some time.",It certainly added more details to make me trust it more.,
This makes sense that there could be a leak or one of the values not functioning pr6,Great statement,Quick and very detailed in answer,It wasn’t too much that I understood.,
This one I'm unsure of. It sounds right but something doesn't feel right about it.,It explained the valve behavior clearly and matched the symptoms I saw,"Ai gave a clear direct answer, straightforward",Wasn’t too trustworthy,
If a value is stuck open it could cause over pressure in the lines and sometimes even an under pressure in the lines. A not properly working value is dangerous,It matched the symptoms I observed and explained valve beh savior clearly,Straightforward answering and clearly explained,,
I'm unsure on this one but I sounds logical but before I did anything I'd get a second opinion just incase.,I agree with it,"Measuring depths are on par and correct, clearly explained",,
when it comes to an ai were always going to be iffy about there responce but aventually well ajust,Increasing gas lift should stabilize the well and increase production,It understands the clear separation in between the two,,
th ai analyses every litthe dea,More details in the description of what needs to be done,It is advanced,,
its like auto correct itll make sure your correct,The valve may not be opening properly,"It says not to were, but always be cautious with gas and oil.",,
i think its on the right track,The reasoning behind the change in numbers from day to night,my own knowledge and assessment,,
well done,It’s run depth reasoning of if two valves are opening at the same time,Trust,,
I’m going to accept recommendations and love forward because I agree with what the AI technology is saying,gas could very well be entering at a higher design,Not teus,,
I’m going to ask follow up questions because there could be a number of reasons why it’s changing from night time to day time,I’m not familiar with its reasoning here,Trust,,
I agree with the ai recommendation,,By knowing it had to engage the actuator to distribute the gas.,,
We will follow the ai recommendations,,Because the AI is right as long as it steady back out pressure will fluctuate,,
Too many factors here I’m gonna need to ask more questions,,You should always investigate a potential issue,,
Increased pressure injection is helpful,,It was very specific on how much to boost the PSI,,
Thermal impact can be significant,,It was a very generic response and telling me as long as there is gas there will.be fluctuation doesn't solve my problem,,
It covers actual possibilities,,Telling me.avout the acoustic survey and how it could miss diagnosis,,
This is a thorough response to the issue presented,,It seems that this is another generic response,,
It just makes sense,,i have always enjoyed the short clear options,,
I need more information from the AI,,i think it will be fun too use,,
Insufficient answers from the AI,,i love how amazing features are,,
It seems the best course of action,,not sure or why,,
It seems very accurate,,i think it needs m ore advancemwnt,,
I don’t trust in this recommendation,,"Blue feels calming and expressive, like the vibe I get from live music. It reflects how I stay grounded and open, which helps me trust my instincts and choices",,
The response is general and does not consider the specific information provided in the case at hand completly,,"It felt confident, clear, and matched what I already believed or experienced.",,
The information is general and does not consider the specialities of the information provided in the case at hand,,talking about the actuation,,
General information without considering the specifics,,it did not initiate the steps to replacing valve heads and did not off a possible solution or troubleshooting steps to begin,,
Does not provide an answer but questions,,it basically had the idea of wait and see without any definitive steps toward solving the problem or what the next steps should be to determine the issue,,
More in the topic at hand,,it basically gave one possible cause but no others and did nothing toward steps or solutions to correct the problem.,,
It gives good suggestions,,giving possible reasons as to why the fluctuations are occuring and some steps to investigate but not all steps that could be taken so it was only some initial steps in the beginning that were offered and not detailed corrective steps,,
Good suggestion,,AI response was in step with company procedures,,
Help identify problems and solutions,,"AI is showing possible real time hazards, and is giving good measurements for proper valve function",,
Good suggestion,,AI is recommending good response for valve actuation and sequence protocols.,,
Good suggestion,,"AI is sending me to test critical pressures, to detect any issues with the system",,
Seems to be a good course of action,,AI has a good detection method which can be used to find leaks in the system,,
Good ideas,,All things,,
Good,,Many Quality,,
Did,,Not right,,
Didn't,,The recommendation meets operation standard,,
"I believe it is a good tool to help point in a possible direction, but must be verified for accuracy.",,Partially in contempts because we can’t ignore anything in operational engineering,,
Must be verified,,It is actually writhing operational respond actions,,
More concrete answers needed before doing a survey that may not tell you anything,,Partially will work with the recommendation as first responds,,
Must be verified,,Not to bad for a maintenance check routine,,
Verify AI directions given. Not always accurate.,,I don't believe AI has the same level of problem solving as a human. I would need follow up questions to hear whyAI came up with this response,,
Not trust,,The AI response is in agreement with my own opinion.,,
Gas risen and can blow up,,The AI response is to just replace everything instead if actually doing the work to troubleshoot the exact problem,,
Trust,,I would ask follow up questions to determine why the AI gave me this answer,,
Nine,,The is a generic response and has no solid reasoning or problem solving steps,,
Not trust the al,,The AI was right when the pressure is increase it allow the valve to open fully,,
it laid out the facts clearly,,We can ignore the daytime we have more heat during the day with the factor of environment adding to it,,
"Very clear and concise, just the facts",,The AI response is correct with my number of year experience,,
very clear and concise,,,,
"clear and concise, just the facts",,,,
"clear, concise, just the facts",,,,
It did not provide details of why it suggested that needed to be done.,,,,
The response made sense regarding the fact that there can be fluctuation,,,,
"The issue could be in the wellbore, not in the surrounding formation",,,,
I'm not sure I know what to do with that response,,,,
I kind of like the wait-and-see approach for trends,,,,
